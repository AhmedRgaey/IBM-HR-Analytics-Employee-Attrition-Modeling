## :writing_hand: Project Description:
IBM is an American MNC operating in around 170 countries with major business vertical as computing, software, and hardware.
Attrition is a major risk to service-providing organizations where trained and experienced people are the assets of the company.
The organization would like to identify the factors which influence the attrition of employees.

## :innocent: Motivation
One of important things that any company must take a deepest look at it is the employee attrition.
So i start look throught this dataset to build up a logistic regression model to predict which employees are likely to attrite.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here [Click to Download](https://github.com/AhmedRgaey/IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Modeling/blob/main/Data/IBM%20Attrition%20Data.csv)
